🔌 Electricity Consumption Analysis

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing electricity consumption data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Using Python and key libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the data is cleaned, analyzed, and presented through easy-to-understand plots and summaries.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is CDCF.csv, which contains the following important columns:

Circle

Division

SubDivision

Area

Units

Load

Total Services

Billed Services

Category Description

Month (if available)

🎯 Objectives
We performed the following analyses:

Relationship between Load and Units Consumed

Top 10 Areas with the Highest Electricity Consumption

Comparison of Billed Services vs Total Services

Electricity Consumption by Circle

Distribution of Billed Services

Electricity Consumption by Consumer Category

Distribution of Electrical Load

(Optional) Monthly Trend of Electricity Consumption

📊 Visualizations
To help understand the data better, the following visualizations were created:

Bar Plot: Total electricity consumption by Circle

Scatter Plot: Total Services vs Billed Services

Histogram: Distribution of Load

Bar Chart: Electricity usage by Consumer Category

Heatmap: Correlation between Units, Load, Services, etc.

Bar Chart: Top 10 Areas by electricity consumption

Line Plot (if Month data exists): Monthly electricity usage trend

Box Plot: Distribution of Billed Services

Scatter Plot: Relationship between Load and Units

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values using mean or median imputation

Converted columns to proper data types

Removed duplicate entries

Simplified column names where needed

Filtered top categories and areas for cleaner plots

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – for data loading and preprocessing

Matplotlib – for basic charts

Seaborn – for attractive statistical visualizations

📌 Conclusion
This project helps understand how electricity is consumed in different regions and categories. It highlights:

Which areas consume the most

How billed services compare to total services

Correlations between load and units

Differences by consumer categories

These insights can be useful for policy makers, electricity boards, and analysts looking to optimize power distribution and identify abnormal consumption patterns.# Python_Ca2
